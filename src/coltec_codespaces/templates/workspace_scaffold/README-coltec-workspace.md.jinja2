# Coltec Workspace: {{ workspace_name }}

This workspace wraps the asset repo at `codebase/` and layers on Coltec's tooling, devcontainer, and governance defaults.

| Field      | Value               |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Org        | `{{ org_slug }}`    |
| Project    | `{{ project_slug }}`|
| Environment| `{{ workspace_name }}` |

## Layout
- `codebase/` – primary application repository (git submodule from `{{ asset_repo_url }}`)
- `.devcontainer/` – generated devcontainer.json, lifecycle scripts, and workspace spec
- `agent-context/` – scratch space for AI planning/checkpoints
- `scratch/` – general scratchpad for experiments, logs, temp assets

## Commands
- `uv run coltec-codespaces render .devcontainer/workspace-spec.yaml --output .devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- `mise run human:setup-env` (optional) to install human shell comforts into `.human/` and link `~/.zshrc`

### Human setup semantics
- The `.human/` directory is git-ignored; use it for personal shell settings.
- `human:setup-env` is safe to re-run; it only bootstraps missing pieces and links `~/.zshrc` if absent.
- If you already have a custom `~/.zshrc`, keep it; the task will not overwrite.

Feel free to customize the post-create/post-start scripts, but keep shared tooling in the `coltec-codespaces` repo so other workspaces benefit too.
